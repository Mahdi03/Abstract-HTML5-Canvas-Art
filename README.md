# Abstract HTML5 Canvas Art
This is a quick project I created for fun because I was bored.


This project is a static HTML5 File that takes advantage of the `<canvas></canvas>` Element and a little bit of JavaScript.


Together, it randomizes lines, circles, and rectangles and all of their colors into a small `800x800` `<canvas></canvas>`. It was based off of a AP Computer Sciences Project where Snap, like Scratch from MIT, but is from Berkeley, was used to Randomize Circles, Triangles, And Other Shapes on a small canvas, with "blocks of code". I took it upon myself to try and make something similar with real JavaScript Code that could be used somewhere in real-life.
